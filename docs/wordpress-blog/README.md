# abhipsnl.wordpress.com - Complete WordPress Blog Kit

This folder contains a complete, WordPress-ready launch package inspired by the repository README and tailored for a high-credibility, high-shareability blog launch.

## Theme Choice (Best for WordPress.com)

**Recommended theme: Twenty Twenty-Four**

Why this is the best fit:
- Native block theme with excellent performance on WordPress.com
- Clean, modern typography that suits technical storytelling
- Flexible full-site editing without custom code dependency

## Honest Viral Hook (Chosen)

**"The real cost is not wrong documentation. It is not knowing it is wrong until it hurts you."**

Why this hook works:
- Emotionally true for engineers, SREs, and leaders
- Specific and concrete (not hypey)

5. Go to **Appearance -> Editor -> Styles**:
   - Choose a clean style variant
   - Set Accent color to `#2563eb`
6. Go to **Appearance -> Customize -> Additional CSS** and paste `theme-customizer.css`.

## Recommended Homepage Structure

Keep the homepage clear and sharp:
1. Hero heading with the hook
2. 1-2 sentence subheadline
3. CTA buttons: "Read the flagship post" and "Start here"
4. Latest 3 posts
5. Newsletter block (or Subscribe block)

## Editorial Positioning

Voice:
- Plainspoken
- Technical but accessible
- Strong opinion backed by operational reality

Avoid:

- 3+ inbound DMs asking for product/demo details
- 10+ new email subscribers (if newsletter enabled)

If you want, I can also generate a second import pack optimized for a **personal founder voice** (less product-led, more narrative-led), while preserving the same honest hook.
